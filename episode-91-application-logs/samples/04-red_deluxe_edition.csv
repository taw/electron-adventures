Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,I'm walking fast through the traffic lights,1
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Busy streets and busy lives,2
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,And all we know is touch and go,3
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,We are alone with our changing minds,4
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds,5
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Or fades in time,6
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,And I never (Never),7
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Saw you coming,8
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,And I’ll never (Never),9
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Be the same,10
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,You come around and the armor falls,11
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Pierce the room like a cannonball,12
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Now all we know is don’t let go,13
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,"We are alone, just you and me",14
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Up in your room and our slates are clean,15
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes",16
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,So you were never a saint,17
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,And I've loved in shades of wrong,18
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,We learn to live with the pain,19
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Mosaic broken hearts,20
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,But this love is brave and wild,21
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,And I never (Never),22
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Saw you coming,23
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,And I’ll never (Never),24
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Be the same,25
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,This is a state of grace,26
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,This is the worthwhile fight,27
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Love is a ruthless game,28
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Unless you play it good and right,29
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,These are the hands of fate,30
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,You’re my Achilles heel,31
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,This is the golden age,32
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Of something good and right and real,33
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,And I never (Never),34
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,Saw you coming,35
Red (Deluxe Edition),State of Grace,1,And I’ll never,36

Red (Deluxe Edition),All Too Well,5,I remember it all too well,34
Red (Deluxe Edition),All Too Well,5,And you call me up again,35
Red (Deluxe Edition),All Too Well,5,Just to break me like a promise,36
Red (Deluxe Edition),All Too Well,5,So casually cruel in the name of being honest,37
Red (Deluxe Edition),All Too Well,5,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,38
