Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,He said the way my blue eyes shined,1
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,2
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,"I said, ""That's a lie""",3
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Just a boy in a Chevy truck,4
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,5
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,On back roads at night,6
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And I was right there beside him all summer long,7
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone,8
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,But when you think Tim McGraw,9
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think my favorite song,10
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,The one we danced to all night long,11
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,The moon like a spotlight on the lake,12
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think happiness,13
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think that little black dress,14
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Think of my head on your chest,15
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And my old faded blue jeans,16
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think Tim McGraw,17
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think of me,18
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,September saw a month of tears,19
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And thankin' God that you weren't here,20
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,To see me like that,21
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,But in a box beneath my bed,22
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Is a letter that you never read,23
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,From three summers back,24
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet,25
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,"And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe",26
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think Tim McGraw,27
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think my favorite song,28
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,The one we danced to all night long,29
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,The moon like a spotlight on the lake,30
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think happiness,31
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think that little black dress,32
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Think of my head on your chest,33
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And my old faded blue jeans,34
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think Tim McGraw,35
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think of me,36
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And I'm back for the first time since then,37
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I'm standin' on your street,38
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And there's a letter left on your doorstep,39
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And the first thing that you'll read is:,40
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,"""When you think Tim McGraw",41
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think my favorite song,42
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Someday you'll turn your radio on,43
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,"I hope it takes you back to that place""",44
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think happiness,45
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think that little black dress,46
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Think of my head on your chest,47
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And my old faded blue jeans,48
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think Tim McGraw,49
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think of me,50
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,"Oh, think of me",51
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Mmmm,52
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,He said the way my blue eyes shined,53
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,54

Taylor Swift,Cold As You,5,You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray,9
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,5,And I stood there loving you and wished them all away,10
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,5,And you come away with a great little story,11

Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,"And, baby, I've got nowhere to go",4
Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,I tried to take the road less traveled by,5
Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,But nothing seems to work the first few times,6
Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,Am I right?,7
Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,So how can I ever try to be better?,8
Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,Nobody ever lets me in,9

Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,That I would give it all up to be,16
Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,"A part of this, a part of you",17
Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,And now it's all too late. So you see,18
Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,You could've helped if you had wanted to,19
Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,But no one notices until it's too late to do anything,20

Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,1
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,Is the face in the mirror looking back at you,2
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,3
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,But that's not true 'cause I know you,4

Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,And no one knows,8
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone",9
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,That you might not be the golden one,10
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,And you're tied together with a smile,11
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,But you're coming undone,12
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,I guess it's true that love was all you wanted,13
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change,14
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,7,Hoping it will end up in his pocket,15
