Speak Now (Deluxe),Back to December,3,"And I think about summer, all the beautiful times",20
Speak Now (Deluxe),Back to December,3,I watched you laughing from the passenger side and,21
Speak Now (Deluxe),Back to December,3,Realized I loved you in the fall,22
Speak Now (Deluxe),Back to December,3,And then the cold came,23
Speak Now (Deluxe),Back to December,3,The dark days when fear crept into my mind,24
Speak Now (Deluxe),Back to December,3,"You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye",25

Speak Now (Deluxe),Back to December,3,The first time you ever saw me cry,36
Speak Now (Deluxe),Back to December,3,Maybe this is wishful thinking,37
Speak Now (Deluxe),Back to December,3,Probably mindless dreaming,38
Speak Now (Deluxe),Back to December,3,"But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right",39
Speak Now (Deluxe),Back to December,3,"I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't",40

Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now,4,It seems that I was uninvited,26
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now,4,By your lovely bride-to-be,27
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now,4,She floats down the aisle,28
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now,4,Like a pageant queen,29

Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,On the side-lines wishing for right now,20
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,We are the kings and the queens,21
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,You traded your baseball cap for a crown,22
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,When they gave us our trophies,23
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,And we held them up for our town,24
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,And the cynics were outraged,25
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,"Screaming, ""This is absurd""",26

Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,Promise me this,43
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,That you'll stand by me forever,44
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,"But if, God forbid, fate should step in",45
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,And force us into a goodbye,46
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,If you have children some day,47
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long Live,14,When they point to the pictures,48
