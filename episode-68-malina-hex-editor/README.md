# Malina.js template

This template for new [Malina.js](https://malinajs.github.io) web-application.

# Developing

```
npm run dev
```

... and open browser on [http://localhost:7000]().

Edit files in `src` directory or put you static files in `public`. Web-application opened in development mode will be reloaded on each change.

# Deploy

Run command below to build your web-application into optimized buundle:

```
npm run build
```

Now you can run `npm run start` to launch your app in the Node environment.

Or just upload content from the `public` directory on any static files hosting like Github Pages or any shared hosting.

But the easiest way to publish your app in the Internet is [Surge](https://surge.sh/). Just run this command and get the URL where your app is hosted:

```
npm run surge
```
