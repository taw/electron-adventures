Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,How many days did I spend thinking,1
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?",2
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,Lived in the shade you were throwing,3
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone",4
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,And I couldn't get away from ya,5
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah",6
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"Your name on my lips, tongue-tied",7
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"Free rent, living in my mind",8
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,But then something happened one magical night,9
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,I forgot that you existed,10
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't",11
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,And it was so nice,12
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,So peaceful and quiet,13
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,I forgot that you existed,14
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference",15
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,I forgot that you,16
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,Got out some popcorn,17
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"As soon as my rep started going down, down, down",18
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,Laughed on the school yard,19
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground",20
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,And I would've stuck around for ya,21
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"Would've fought the whole town, so yeah",22
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"Would've been right there, front row",23
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,Even if nobody came to your show,24
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"But you showed who you are, then one magical night",25
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,I forgot that you existed,26
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't",27
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,And it was so nice,28
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,So peaceful and quiet,29
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,I forgot that you existed,30
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference",31
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,I forgot that you,32
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,Sent me a clear message,33
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,Taught me some hard lessons,34
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,I just forget what they were,35
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,It's all just a blur,36
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,I forgot that you existed,37
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't",38
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,And it was so nice,39
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,So peaceful and quiet,40
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,I forgot that you existed,41
Lover,I Forgot That You Existed,1,"I did, I did, I did",42
